# Cp_Unix

Implement a simplified version of the UNIX program "cp" , which copies one file to another. Call the file csc60cp.c. This version copies only files. The following conditions should be treated as errors: (1) it does not permit the second argument to be a directory 
(2) it does not permit a file to copy to itself. We also ignore all options in command "csc60cp".

This programâ€™s uses a sample code From LPI(The Linux Programming Interface), then adds to it 
to make the program work with the specified instruction.
